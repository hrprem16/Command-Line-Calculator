# Command-Line-Calculator
A command line calculator which supports mathematical expressions with scientific functions is very useful for most developers. The calculator available with Windows does not support most scientific functions

PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

In this command line calculator, the result is saved in a pre-defined variable called ans. The user can declare his/her own variables to store results and can use it later in different expressions. The validation of the variable name is the same as in C#. Similarly, expression support is the same as supported in C# , .NET.
